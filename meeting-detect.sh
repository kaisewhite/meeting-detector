# detect-meeting.sh
# Purpose: Heuristically detect when *any* desktop meeting app starts a meeting by
# watching for microphone/camera access grants in macOS Unified Logs (TCC)
# and correlating with the frontmost app at that moment. Prints compact JSON lines.
#
# Notes:
# - This is app-agnostic: Zoom, Slack Huddles, Meet (via Chrome), Teams, Webex, etc.
# - Triggers on first-time (or resumed) mic/camera usage events emitted by TCC.
# - Requires no special entitlements; may miss events if the app had continuous access
#   without re-requesting. Thatâ€™s why we also add a lightweight camera process probe.
#
# Usage: bash detect-meeting.sh
# Stop  : Ctrl+C
